{{% resource_link "7afa54e8-f6f6-4f4d-a62d-d0abf03ea53d" "The String Landscape, Black Holes and Gravity as the Weakest Force" %}}: This is a paper which says something interesting about arbitrarily-weakly-gauged symmetries and black holes.

{{% resource_link "b036ab25-772a-4763-820f-994b48b25961" "UV/IR Relations in AdS Dynamics" %}}: This paper has some thoughtful discussion of the relationship between the radial coordinate of AdS and various energy scales in the field theory.
