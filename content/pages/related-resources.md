{{% resource_link "eb18d302-cf9c-48d5-8f51-b5e74839f4bf" "The String Landscape, Black Holes and Gravity as the Weakest Force" %}}: This is a paper which says something interesting about arbitrarily-weakly-gauged symmetries and black holes.

{{% resource_link "86238405-2555-44aa-84a3-b192c1dd195c" "UV/IR Relations in AdS Dynamics" %}}: This paper has some thoughtful discussion of the relationship between the radial coordinate of AdS and various energy scales in the field theory.
